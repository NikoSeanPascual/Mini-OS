## Features

- 🖥️ Terminal-based mini OS experience  
- 📝 Unit Converter (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit, Inches ↔ Centimeters, Feet ↔ Meters)  
- 🔤 Letter Counter (count occurrences of a letter in a text)  
- 🎯 Hidden Number Game (guess the number 1-10)

## How It Works

When you start the program, a **login screen** will appear. You must enter the correct credentials to access the apps:  

- **Username:** `niko sean`  
- **Password:** `12345`  

Once logged in, you can access the **mini OS menu**, which allows you to choose from multiple apps. Each app demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as loops, functions, user input handling, dictionaries, randomization, and timing.
